Homework for R class MAP536.

```{r}
library(HOMEWORKWAN)
```


##Functions:

The `draw_a_name` function takes a name and gender as input and plots the development of the name in France.

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
draw_a_name("Vincent","M")
```

Similarly, `draw_names` and `draw_names_dygraph` are able to plot the history of multiple names at the same time.

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
draw_names(c("Vincent","Diane"))
draw_names_dygraph(c("Vincent","Diane"))
```

`multi_excel` takes a string of a xlsx file including its path and reads the sheets into a list object. `my_csv_reader` puts all csv files in a directory as dataframes into a list. `save_as_csv(df,file_name)` takes a dataframe as input and saves into under a given name and path.
